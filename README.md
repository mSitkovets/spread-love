This project was made for Boston Hacks 2019.

Many people want to donate to charities but are unable to because of the inconvenience of finding the proper charities and cannot donate large amounts of money toward the specific charity. This mobile application solves that by simulating an environment where every future purchase is rounded to the next nearest dollar and donates the difference to a charity.
